                     The SMS Blast System typically operates through an online
                     platform or software. Users can upload their contact lists
                     or segment their audience based on specific criteria. They
                     then compose a customized SMS message, which can include
                     their brand or company name. After scheduling the blast at
                     the desired time or using automation, the system sends out
                     the messages to all recipients simultaneously.
